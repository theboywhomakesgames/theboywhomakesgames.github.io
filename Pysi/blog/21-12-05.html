<h1>My first blog post!</h1>
<p>This is my first blog post! Yaaay! This means my blog is reaching the state in which I can post things on it. Then You can read it and all. It's so exciting to be able to share my opinions about stuff on my own blog hosted on github. I'm an easy person to excite. That kinda means my excitement is cheap and not that valuable. To you! NOT TO ME THOUGH. It's awesome to be easy to excite. This means I get be happy more than a normal person. I still feel that intensity and that rush of a good feeling no matter how many times through out the day it happens. Any ways. Let's see the world through my eys a little bit.</p>
