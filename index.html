<p>Hi! This is the new home of my blog. I made it with pysi! You may ask, WTF is pysi? And I'd be glad to answer. It's a static website builder with no bullshit and it's super simple python code and it's open source for you to develop it further however you like and it's a simple way to make a github blog!</p>
